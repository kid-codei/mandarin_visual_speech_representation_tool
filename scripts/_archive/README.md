# Archived Scripts

Scripts that were archived and what they were replaced by:

- `insert_sentence_data.py`: Initially only handled traditional characters, wanted to add simplified characters and pinyin, so the schemas needed to be updated
- `update_schema_add_simplified.py`: This worked in tandem with the insert_sentences_data.py file but once again only handled logic for traditional characterspython scripts/import_sentences_from_json.py
